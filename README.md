# Numerical-IK-Optimization
A computational study comparing the efficiency of the Newton-Raphson numerical method against analytical solutions for 2-DOF planar manipulators. This repository features MATLAB implementations of Jacobian-based inverse kinematics , demonstrating the scalability of numerical optimization for high-degree-of-freedom robotic systems.
